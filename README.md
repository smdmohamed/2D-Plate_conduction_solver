# 2D-Plate_conduction_solver
this was donne as a homework during my first year at the Mechanical Engineering Dept. of the Ecole National Polytechnique.
This repository contains 2 matlab files for solving a 2D consuction problem in a solid plate:

Tdif_fin.m: Finite deference solver

Tanali.m: Exact solution solver.

The Dm1_TCh_SEMMAD file contain the report that explain the method and discuss the results.
